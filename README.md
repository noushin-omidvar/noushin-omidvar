# Hello World üëã

**Noushin is here!**

I‚Äôm an Applied scientist who loves teaching machines to understand molecules. My work brings together AI and chemistry to imagine new materials ‚Äî from graph neural networks that learn bonding patterns to generative models that design better electrolytes for the next generation of batteries.

I‚Äôve traveled through both academia (Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering at Virginia Tech) and industry (Aionics Inc.), always chasing the same goal: using machine learning as a tool for discovery. For me, the exciting part isn‚Äôt just building models ‚Äî it‚Äôs uncovering the hidden rules of nature that those models reveal.

When I‚Äôm not coding or analyzing molecules, I enjoy mentoring, collaborating across disciplines, and asking big ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù questions that push science forward.

Areas of interest: AI for Science & Engineering, Cheminformatics & Molecular Modeling, Optimization & Generative Design, Explainable & Interpretable AI
If you're looking for a collaborator who can bring a fresh perspective and a wealth of technical expertise to your project, look no further!
